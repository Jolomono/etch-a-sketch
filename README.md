# etch-a-sketch

This project is to create a web page with a 16 x 16 grid that reacts like an etch a sketch when moused over. This... this could change everything. I'm going in...

Currently the web page generates a 16 x 16 grid of cells that fill in when moused over, but doesn't have functionality to clear the screen or to create a different size of grid.
