# etch-a-sketch

This project is to create a web page with a 16 x 16 grid that reacts like an etch a sketch when moused over. This... this could change everything. I'm going in...

The grid can be resized to have different amounts of boxes within the grid. The grid can also be cleared using a button at the top of the screen. 

Updated the project to include options to fill in the grid boxes with gray, random colors, or to shade gradually from gray to black.
